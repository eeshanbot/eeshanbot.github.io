Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Investigator at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Applied Ocean Physics & Engineering and Physical Oceanography.

As an engineer, I found my way into oceanography by mostly random chance, attracted to its interdisciplinary and collaborative nature, data driven and observational work, and important role in our climate.
