Welcome! I am a _Staff Scientist_ at Applied Ocean Sciences.

As an engineer, I found my way into oceanography by mostly random chance, attracted to its interdisciplinary nature, data driven and observational work, and important role in our climate. My key focus is making underwater sensing networks more autonomous and more interconnected, with a particular focus in marine autonomy and embedded acoustic sensing. From technical challenges to social ones, I take a systems-level approach and thrive working on highly dynamic teams.
