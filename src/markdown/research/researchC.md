Sensors onboard underwater platforms provide ample opportunity for real-time filtering, classifying, and compression. I work with standard oceanographic sensors as well as acoustic packages like modems, hydrophone arrays, and vector sensors, in pursuit of better communication and adaptive behavior underway.
