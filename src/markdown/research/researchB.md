From polar to littoral to hadal environments, there is an increasing focus on gathering interconnected data sets to understand complex mechanisms: how heat and carbon are regulated; how biological, mineral, and energy resources are stored; how human activity, including microplastics, pollution, or commerce, imbalance biogeochemical processes and ecosystems  with no concern to political boundaries; the list goes on. Placing observations at the forefront of the narrative grants a realistic picture of current conditions, corroborates the physics that governs observed phenomena, and contextualizes what models can and cannot answer. I am passionate about how the next generation of "big data" oceanography will center co-ownership across local communities, collaboration across multiple stakeholders, and data discovery for all.
