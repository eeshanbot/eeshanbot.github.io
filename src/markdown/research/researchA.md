I am captivated by co-evolution of artificial intelligence and autonomous sensing platforms to curate scientific datasets of higher quality and unprecedented spatio-temporal access.
Heterogeneous intelligence sensing networks that can collect sustained observations and support navigation for transient mobile platforms provide organic sampling modalities for important oceanographic features at various spatial and temporal scales.
The potential to displace ship-based oceanography and transition from teams of humans supervising one robot to teams of robots supervised together poses fascinating technical questions around embedded acoustics, artificial intelligence, and coordinated systems of control.
